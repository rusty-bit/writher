## 🆕 What's New

- 🔢 **Symbol & code spelling** — say "forward slash", "dash", "semicolon", or number words and they type as actual characters. Spell code letter-by-letter: *"W H forward slash F A T"* → `WH/FAT`. Always active, no mode switch needed.
- 🔒 **Single-instance lock** — launching a second copy exits immediately, preventing double-paste.
- 🤖 **Ollama auto-management** — WritHer downloads and starts Ollama automatically on first launch and pulls `llama3.2:3b` if no model is present. No manual setup required.
- 🎨 **Per-mode colour themes** — dictation widget renders in cyan, assistant in violet.
- ⌨️ **Combo hotkeys** — assistant hotkey is now `Ctrl+Alt+R` (avoids browser conflicts). Settings window captures live key combos.
- 🗑️ **Delete by voice** - say "delete the dentist appointment" or "remove the shopping list" and WritHer finds and removes it. Voice confirmation required before any deletion (15s timeout).
- ⌨️ **Customizable hotkeys** - change dictation and assistant shortcuts from Settings. Press the ⌨ button, hit any key, done. No restart needed.
- 🎙️ **Microphone selection** - pick your input device from Settings, with hot-plug refresh
- 🔄 **Toggle recording mode** - press once to start, press again to stop (alternative to hold)
- ⏱️ **Safety timeout** - auto-stops recording in toggle mode if you forget
- 🎨 **Redesigned UI** - CustomTkinter with unified Pandora Blackboard theme (pure black + bright white)
- 🖥️ **Resizable Notes window** - drag to resize, maximize/restore, DPI-aware
- ⚡ **Faster Ollama responses** - timeout increased from 10s to 30s for larger models
- 🐛 **Bug fixes** - clean shutdown, widget positioning, visual artifacts removed
- 🔌 **Reliable mic switching** - select any microphone (USB, Bluetooth, AirPods) from Settings and switch on the fly without restart. Tested with Bluetooth HFP devices.
- 📦 **Standalone exe** - download and run, no Python installation required. Whisper model downloads automatically on first launch.
- ⚙️ **Full Settings panel** - Ollama model/URL, Whisper model, language, microphone, recording mode - all configurable from the tray menu.
- 🎯 **Toggle mode fix** - resolved issue where Ctrl+Alt+R required double-press to start recording. Added debounce to prevent key-repeat interference.
- 🎤 **Sample rate fix** - microphones with 48kHz default (e.g. Logitech C310) now work correctly. Audio is recorded at 16kHz when possible, resampled if not.
- 📁 **Portable data paths** - database, logs, and recovery files stored in %APPDATA%/WritHer when running as exe, preventing permission issues.
- ✓ **Cleaner widget feedback** - assistant confirmations show minimal icons instead of long text that overflowed the widget.

> 💬 **Feedback welcome!** If you test WritHer with different microphones or setups, please [open an issue](https://github.com/rusty-bit/writher/issues) and let us know how it goes. Your feedback helps improve the app for everyone.

## What is WritHer?

WritHer sits quietly in your system tray and gives you two super-powers:

| Mode | Hotkey (default) | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Dictation** | `AltGr` | Transcribes your voice and pastes the text directly into whichever app has focus - editors, browsers, chat windows, anything. Symbols and numbers are substituted automatically. |
| **Assistant** | `Ctrl+Alt+R` | Understands natural-language commands and saves notes, creates appointments, sets reminders, manages lists - all by voice. |

Both hotkeys are **fully customizable** from the Settings window, click the ⌨ button next to each shortcut and press your preferred key. The change takes effect immediately, no restart required.

Both hotkeys support two recording modes, configurable from the **Settings** window in the system tray:

| Recording mode | How it works |
|---|---|
| **Hold** (default) | Hold the key to record, release to stop. |
| **Toggle** | Press once to start recording, press again to stop. A configurable safety timeout auto-stops the recording if you forget. |

Everything runs **locally**: speech recognition via [faster-whisper](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper), intent parsing via [Ollama](https://ollama.com), and data stored in a local SQLite database. No cloud, no API keys, no telemetry.

---

## Features

- **Real-time dictation** - speak and text appears. Supports both hold-to-record and toggle (press to start/stop) modes.
- **Symbol & code substitution** - always-on post-processing converts spoken symbol names and number words to characters before pasting. Say *"W H forward slash F A T"* → `WH/FAT`, *"one two three"* → `123`, *"semicolon"* → `;`. Consecutive single letters are merged automatically so spelling out code identifiers works naturally.
- **Voice-controlled assistant** - save notes, create shopping/todo lists, schedule appointments, set reminders, and delete items by voice. All through natural speech.
- **Voice delete with confirmation** - say "delete the shopping list" or "remove the dentist appointment". WritHer finds the item by keyword and asks for voice confirmation before deleting. 15-second timeout for safety.
- **Smart date parsing** - say *"remind me tomorrow at 9"* or *"meeting next Monday at 3pm"* and the LLM converts relative times to absolute datetimes.
- **Toast notifications** - get Windows notifications when reminders fire or appointments are approaching.
- **Animated floating widget** - a minimal pill-shaped overlay with expressive "Pandora Blackboard" eyes that react to state (listening, thinking, happy, error, etc.). Cyan for dictation, violet for assistant.
- **Notes & Agenda window** - a dark-themed resizable window to browse, check off list items, and delete notes/appointments/reminders. Supports maximize/restore and drag-to-resize.
- **Settings window** - configure recording mode, max recording duration, keyboard shortcuts, and microphone device directly from the system tray. All settings are persisted across restarts.
- **Customizable combo hotkeys** - reassign dictation and assistant keys (including multi-key combos like `Ctrl+Alt+R`) from the Settings window. Blocked keys are rejected, duplicate detection prevents conflicts.
- **Microphone selection** - choose your input device from a dropdown in Settings. Supports hot-plug detection with a refresh button - no restart needed.
- **Ollama auto-management** - WritHer installs and launches Ollama automatically if it is not already running, and pulls the default model on first use.
- **Single-instance protection** - a system-wide mutex prevents two copies running at once, eliminating the double-paste bug.
- **Modern UI** - built with CustomTkinter and a unified "Pandora Blackboard" theme (pure black + bright white) defined in a single `theme.py` file.
- **Multi-language** - ships with English and Italian; easy to add more via the `locales.py` string table.
- **Fully offline** - no internet required after model download.

## Requirements

- **Windows 10/11**
- A working **microphone**
- Internet connection on first launch (to download the Whisper speech model, ~244 MB for `small`)

> **Ollama** is downloaded and started automatically by WritHer if it is not already installed. You do not need to set it up manually.

---

## Installation

### Option A: Download the exe (recommended)

1. Download `WritHer-v1.2.0-win64.zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/rusty-bit/writher/releases/latest)
2. Extract to any folder
3. Run `WritHer.exe`
4. On first launch, the Whisper model and Ollama are downloaded automatically
5. Right-click the tray icon for **Settings** and **Notes & Agenda**

### Option B: Run from source

#### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rusty-bit/writher.git
cd writher
```

#### 2. Create a virtual environment (recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

> Requires **Python 3.11+**

#### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install faster-whisper numpy sounddevice pynput pystray Pillow requests winotify customtkinter
```

> **Optional:** install `plyer` as a fallback notification backend:
> ```bash
> pip install plyer
> ```

#### 4. Run

```bash
python main.py
```

Writher appears in the system tray. Hold `AltGr` to dictate, hold `Ctrl+Alt+R` for assistant commands. Ollama is started automatically if needed.

---

## Configuration

All settings live in **`config.py`**:

```python
# Hotkeys (defaults — can be changed from Settings at runtime)
HOTKEY = Key.alt_gr                                          # Dictation
ASSISTANT_HOTKEY = (frozenset({"ctrl", "alt"}), KeyCode.from_vk(82))  # Ctrl+Alt+R

# Language ("en" or "it")
LANGUAGE = "en"

# Recording mode
HOLD_TO_RECORD = True          # True = hold key, False = toggle (press/press)
MAX_RECORD_SECONDS = 120       # Safety timeout for toggle mode (seconds)

# Microphone
MIC_DEVICE_NAME = None         # None = system default, or device name (str)

# Whisper
MODEL_SIZE = "small"           # tiny, base, small (default), medium, large-v3
DEVICE = "cpu"                 # "cpu" or "cuda"
COMPUTE_TYPE = "int8"          # int8, float16, float32

# Ollama
OLLAMA_URL = "http://localhost:11434"
OLLAMA_MODEL = "llama3.2:3b"

# Notification lead time
APPOINTMENT_REMIND_MINUTES = 15
```

> **Note:** `HOLD_TO_RECORD`, `MAX_RECORD_SECONDS`, `MIC_DEVICE_NAME`, `HOTKEY`, and `ASSISTANT_HOTKEY` can also be changed at runtime from the **Settings** window in the system tray. Changes made there are persisted in the database and override `config.py` defaults.

### Choosing a Whisper model

| Model | Size | Speed | Accuracy |
|---|---|---|---|
| `tiny` | 39 MB | ⚡ fastest | basic |
| `base` | 74 MB | ⚡ fast | good |
| `small` | 244 MB | moderate | better **(default)** |
| `medium` | 769 MB | slower | great |
| `large-v3` | 1.5 GB | slowest | best |

> The `small` model is the default because it handles symbol and code spelling (e.g. "forward slash") reliably. The `base` model can mishear multi-word phrases and is not recommended for code dictation.

For CUDA acceleration, install `ctranslate2` with CUDA support and set `DEVICE = "cuda"`.

---

## Usage

### Dictation mode

**Hold mode** (default):

1. Focus any text field (editor, browser, chat…)
2. **Hold** `AltGr`
3. Speak
4. **Release** - transcribed text is pasted automatically

**Toggle mode:**

1. Focus any text field
2. **Press** `AltGr` once to start recording
3. Speak
4. **Press** `AltGr` again to stop - transcribed text is pasted automatically

> In toggle mode, a safety timeout (configurable in Settings) will auto-stop the recording if you forget to press the key again.

### Symbol & code spelling

Symbols and number words are substituted automatically in every dictation. No special mode needed.

| You say | You get |
|---|---|
| `forward slash` | `/` |
| `back slash` | `\` |
| `dash` / `hyphen` / `minus` | `-` |
| `semicolon` | `;` |
| `colon` | `:` |
| `double colon` | `::` |
| `underscore` | `_` |
| `asterisk` | `*` |
| `at sign` | `@` |
| `hash sign` | `#` |
| `open bracket` / `close bracket` | `(` / `)` |
| `open curly` / `close curly` | `{` / `}` |
| `open square` / `close square` | `[` / `]` |
| `new line` | ↵ |
| `one` `two` `three` … `nine` | `1` `2` `3` … `9` |

Spell code identifiers letter-by-letter and spaces are removed automatically:

- *"W H F A T"* → `WHFAT`
- *"W H forward slash F A T"* → `WH/FAT`
- *"one two three dash four five six"* → `123-456`

### Assistant mode

**Hold mode** (default):

1. **Hold** `Ctrl+Alt+R`
2. Speak a command
3. **Release** - Writher processes and confirms

**Toggle mode:**

1. **Press** `Ctrl+Alt+R` once to start recording
2. Speak a command
3. **Press** `Ctrl+Alt+R` again to stop - Writher processes and confirms

**Example commands:**

- *"Save a note: remember to buy milk"*
- *"Create a shopping list: bread, eggs, butter, coffee"*
- *"Add pasta to the shopping list"*
- *"Appointment with the dentist tomorrow at 3pm"*
- *"Remind me to call Marco in one hour"*
- *"Show me my notes"*
- *"Show my agenda"*
- *"Delete the dentist appointment"*
- *"Remove the shopping list"*
- *"Delete the reminder about Marco"*

### System tray

Right-click the tray icon to access:

- **Notes & Agenda** - open the notes/appointments/reminders viewer
- **Settings** - configure recording mode (hold vs toggle), max recording duration, keyboard shortcuts, and microphone device
- **Quit** - exit WritHer

> **Tip:** Windows may hide the tray icon in the overflow area (the ^ arrow). To keep it always visible, go to **Settings → Personalization → Taskbar → Other system tray icons** and enable WritHer.

---

## Adding a language

1. Open `locales.py`
2. Add a new entry to the `_STRINGS` dictionary (copy `"en"` as a template)
3. Set `LANGUAGE` in `config.py` to your language code

## Troubleshooting

**AltGr not detected?**
Run `python debug_keys.py` to see exactly what pynput reports for your keyboard. Some keyboard layouts map AltGr differently.

**Ollama not reachable?**
WritHer attempts to start Ollama automatically. If the assistant still fails, run `ollama serve` manually and verify the URL in `config.py` matches. The tray tooltip shows a warning if the connection fails at startup.

**No audio / microphone not found?**
WritHer uses the system default input device unless you select a specific one in Settings. If the widget shows "🎤 No microphone detected", check your Windows sound settings. You can also open **Settings** from the tray and use the microphone dropdown to pick the correct device. Hit the ⟳ button to refresh the list if you just plugged in a new mic.

**"No speech detected" but microphone works?**
This usually means Whisper received audio but couldn't recognize speech. Common causes:
- Wrong input device selected (e.g. "Stereo Mix" instead of your actual mic) - check the microphone dropdown in Settings
- Microphone volume too low in Windows sound settings (aim for 70-80%)
- The default `small` model requires ~244 MB download on first launch; check the console for progress

**Symbol substitution not working / weird output?**
Make sure the Whisper model is set to `small` or larger in Settings. The `base` model can mishear multi-word phrases like "forward slash" as separate words, producing incorrect substitutions.

**Text not pasting?**
The injector uses `Ctrl+V` via the clipboard. Some apps with custom input handling may not respond. If injection fails, the text is saved to `recovery_notes.txt` so nothing is lost.

**Tray icon not visible?**
Windows 11 hides new tray icons by default. Go to **Settings → Personalization → Taskbar → Other system tray icons** and enable WritHer to keep it always visible.

## Contributing

WritHer is a young project and contributions are very welcome!

Here are the areas where help is most needed:

- **macOS port** - replace Win32 injection and winotify with macOS equivalents
- **Linux port** - same as above for Linux (xdotool, libnotify, etc.)
- **New languages** - just add an entry to `locales.py`
- **Ollama model testing** - report which models work best with function calling
- **Bug reports and UX feedback** - open an issue, any feedback is appreciated

If you want to contribute, feel free to open an issue to discuss your idea first, or just fork and submit a PR. No formal process required, just good intentions.
